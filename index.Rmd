## About me

I'm a third-year PhD student at The University of Sheffield, UK, studying under the supervision of Dr. Renee Timmers (Dept. of Music) and Prof. Guy Brown (Dept. of Computer Science). My doctoral research is concerned with the perception of speech and music by hearing-impaired listeners, including cochlear implant and hearing aid users. Specifically, my thesis addresses auditory perception of emotion, and the objective assessment of music perception. My research makes use of interdisciplinary methodologies, incorporating experimental psychology, psychoacoustics, and computer modelling.
